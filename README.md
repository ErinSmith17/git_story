here is my prompt: You bought a home filled with cutting edge technology, including a helpful 'smart A.I.' that can do just about anything you ask them to. Unbeknownst to you, there actually is no A.I., the house is just haunted by a really helpful spirit, and they are posing as a program so they don't scare you.

here is my frist paragraph: When my family and I bought this house my kids love the A.I. features but my wife was creeped out because she thought it was listening and watching us. She's very cautious about everything and wanted this house to be safe for the kids but I think this house is perfect for them. A.I. technology is very new and critics say "it improves the family's lifestyle by making it smoother and having a better connection", but my wife still thinks it's just another scam. Thankfully before we signed on the house she reluctantly gave in and allowed us to stay. We got a great deal on the house and for us to install this system into a house this old would have cost thousands so, in the end, it was a steal. 

At first the system was better than I thought, I mean it made life so much easier. You could wake up every moring and just tell it to make you breakfast and in seconds you would have steaming pancakes sitting right in front of you. The kids loved it too, said they never had to clean up their messes again cause the A.I. did it for them. Even my wife started comming around it when she realized she could do whatever she wanted know without having to worry about daily chores. It was perfect...but then something strange started happening. The kids were playing upstairs and they found some old picture in the attic, said it looked like a woman from the early 1900s. When they picked it up they said it felt like something was watching then and they started feeling cold on their necks. After that we locked the attic up thinking it was nothing, but now the A.I. started messing up, making little mistakes. It's probably nothing to worry about.

At least, that's what I thought. Last night, I absent-mindedly asked the A.I. if it knew anything about the pictures in the attic. It launched into a detailed description of the woman in the picture's life. The longer it droned on, the worse the pit in my stomach got. I only realized after she finished why I felt so uneasy: she was using the first person. This was Elizabeth speaking to me, telling me every major point in her life leading up to her untimely death. She was a maid of sorts, hence her eager compulsion to help out around the house. But it was more than that. She died pregnant. She wanted to help raise our children, since she never got to raise her own. "I'm so sorry," I muttered, the dread in my body turning to a somber realization.
